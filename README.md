# PictureGameMobile

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating an Android application with various games using images of cars.

This app, like the other Android assignment, had very specific constraints regarding functionality and UI. I fleshed out the app as much as I could within these constraints. Personally, I would have designed these apps differently, but the current iteration demonstrates my technical ability in creating these applications. 

##
The main activity where the user can select 1 of 4 games to play
